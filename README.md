## Tutorial
Welcome to the tutorial! We will walk through the major features of the website in the following paragraphs.

### Home Page
<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home.png">

At the top, there is a fading list of various definitions of cycles throughout mathematics. Next, there is an interactive sliding component that scrolls through current contests that, upon being clicked on, link to their web pages. 

Next, there are three main parallax sections:
* The first, titled **Math Evolved**, contains three sections with large titles that make their respective descriptions appear to the right upon clicking.

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home1.png"><img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home2.png">

* The second, titled **The Core**, describes the four main topic areas of mathematics. When each down arrow is clicked, the description reveals itself in a downwards motion.

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home3.png"><img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home4.png">

* The third contains a list of many popular **contests** throughout the current contest year, with their colors corresponding to whether they are completed, currently happening, or in the future.

### Resources Page
The **resources** page contains an array of varioius online resources with accompanying links, as well as two handouts/PDFs of original content that I authored along with other math team members in high school.

### Login Steps
When you click the **login** button from any of the pages on the site, a login page will fade in: 

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/login.png">

Then, either enter your credentials, or click through to the **sign up** page, where a new page will fade in:

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/signup.png">

Upon signing up successfully, you will be redirected to the **home** page. And when you login, you will have access to the member-only resources at mathcycle. The **profile** tab and **logout** button will now appear at the top of the nav bar:

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/loggedin.png">

### Profile Page
Clicking the **profile** button in the nav bar brings you to the main page of registered users at mathcycle. You will be able to see your total score (problems solved), as well as individual subject scores.

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/profile.png">

In the **practice** section, you will enter the practice module upon clicking on a subject name, bringing you to the next problem not yet solved in that respective area or the **congratulations** page if you've completed all the problems. By clicking on a topic in the **review** section, you will be brought to a page with all the problems you've solved in this subject.

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/profile1.png">

### Practice Page
Here, you will be able to view the original problems we've composed, with fully-embedded LaTeX through MathJax. Upon submitting an answer, you will receive feedback on whether your answer was correct or incorrect. If correct, the next button will appear, allowing you to move on to the next problem or the **congratulations** page if you finished the last problem.

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/practice.png">

Incorrect:

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/practice1.png">

Correct:

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/practice2.png">

Congratulations:

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/practice3.png">

### Review Page
All the problems in the selected subject area that you've completed will appear here in sequential order, and upon clicking on the answer buttons, the answer to the corresponding question will appear/disappear. 

<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/review.png"><img width="100%" src="./tutorial/review1.png">

### Logout Steps
Logging out is as simple as it can be! Simply click the **logout** button at the right of the nav bar, and the logout prompt will fade in to whatever page you are currently on.

### That's it! Thank you for using mathcycle!
