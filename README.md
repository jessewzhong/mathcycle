## Tutorial
Welcome to the tutorial! We will walk through the major features of the website in the following paragraphs.

### Home Page
<img width="100%" src="./tutorial/home.png">

At the top, there is a fading list of various definitions of cycles throughout mathematics. Next, there is an interactive sliding component that scrolls through current contests that, upon being clicked on, link to their web pages. 

Next, there are three main parallax sections:
* The first, titled Math Evolved, contains three sections with large titles that make their respective descriptions appear to the right upon clicking.
* The second, titled The Core, describes the four main topic areas of mathematics. When each down arrow is clicked, the description reveals itself in a downwards motion.
* The third contains a list of many popular contests throughout the current contest year, with their colors corresponding to whether they are completed, currently happening, or in the future.
